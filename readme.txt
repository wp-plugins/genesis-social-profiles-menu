This plugin adds a stylesheet for social profile icons for the WordPress custom menu - recommended for the use with Genesis Framework child themes.

== Description ==
This small and leightweight plugin is intended for the use with the popular Genesis Framework. It adds a special stylesheet for social profile icons for the WordPress custom menu system. The menu system is connected with the (Genesis) menu locations and also with widget areas because WordPress comes with a built-in custom menu widget. This way you can assign social profiles to a lot of locations on your site and easily add your own links, change sorting, change size, tooltips and opening in a new window/tab. So you have a lot of advantages over lots of other social profiles widget plugins around... As soon as you're figured out to add the CSS classes it's really easy, fast and flexible :-). For most use cases and regular Genesis Child Themes this should work really fine. Additional CSS styling/adjusting via child theme is possible of course :).

Please note: The plugin requires the Genesis Theme Framework

== Installation ==
1. Upload `genesis-social-profiles-menu` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Set up a custom menu in WordPress: Appearance > Menu -- or: edit/enhance an existing menu -- just add custom links to your desired services
4. Add the proper CSS classes to these custom links (before this: activate the check boxes for "Custom Links", "Link Target" and "CSS Classes" via the"Screen Options" tab in right top corner below toolbar! [direct link to large view screenshot...](http://s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/genesis-social-profiles-menu/screenshot-1.png))
5. Save menu to the desired menu location or use the WordPress widget for custom menu to place your profiles in any menu location or widget area

= Scheme for the CSS Classes =
It always goes like this: (service)-(iconset)-(size)

** 1st Example: `twitter-prl-s16`**

* you could also add the suffix "-s24" for 24px size or "-s32" for 32px size
* change `twitter` to one of the 12 included services for this icon set
* "prl" stands for the used icon set - at the moment, there's only two sets, maybe more sets following in the future...

** 2nd Example: `pinterest-sp-s32 gspm-sp`**

* you could also add the suffix "-s24" for 24px size or "-s48" for 48px size
* change `pinterest` to one of the 6 included services for this icon set
* `gspm-sp` is the additional helper class to help you style the background colors, hover effects and rounded corners etc. via your child theme
* *note:* this helper class is required for using in the sidebars and footer widgets, otherwise your icons/styles will "crash"...
* "sp" stands for the used icon set - at the moment, there's only two sets, maybe more sets following in the future...

= Available CSS Classes for SP Icon Set =

* Facebook: facebook-sp-s24 / facebook-sp-s32 / facebook-sp-s48
* Google Plus: google-sp-s24 / google-sp-s32 / google-sp-s48

* Twitter: twitter-sp-s24 / twitter-sp-s32 / twitter-sp-s48

*Please consider adding the SP helper class `gspm-sp` to the menu items:* this way you can style the background-color, the background hover color and also decide wheter to use rounded corners or any other style... -- all done via your child theme, you might add the following example code to your `style.css` of your child theme:
`
/* Genesis Social Profiles Menu Plugin: Custom Styles
------------------------------------------------------------ */

/* Background Color + Border Radius etc. */
.gspm-sp {
	background: #b22222 !important;
	border-radius: 25px;
	-moz-border-radius: 25px;
	-webkit-border-radius: 25px;
}

/* Hover Color/ Effects */
.gspm-sp:hover {
	background: #ed702b !important;
}
`
* This will display round icons with red background, with orange background on hover.
* Remember, you may have to add `!important` to some rules to see the custom changes...

= Helper CSS Classes to Add Some More Space :) =
There are also four helper classes included: `space-left` and `space-right` plus `space-top` and `space-bottom` -- when using social items as an addition in a regular menu you might want to add some more space to have a better looking menu. Just an example, your menu goes like this:

Home Blog About [Twitter Icon] [Facebook Icon]

-> You might add the space class to the [Twitter Icon] like so: `twitter-prl-s24 space-left` -- *please note:* no dots and no commas are used here, only the classes separated by one space!

Left & Right classes add 20px space each and Top & Bottom classes 7px each -- *please note:* these values could all be overwritten via your style.css of the child theme when you add `!important` to the css rule.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How Do I Actually Add These Special CSS Classes and Where? =
Just go to the "Menus" settings page in WordPress, then click the "Sreen Options" tab in the top right corner (below the toolbar) and there just activate the check boxes for "Custom Links", "Link Target" and "CSS Classes". After that you have access to the appropriate fields/drop downs for each and every menu items you'll add or edit. (This is then for ALL menu items not only for the social ones you might add... :)

= Could I use this plugin also with another theme/framework? =
Good question but unfortunately this is no possible and not recommended. I've built in a theme check function so it's only useable with the Genesis Framework and its child themes. The reason for that is simple because the icons stylesheet references a lot of unique Genesis CSS IDs and classes so it will be nearly unuseable with other themes. However, you might have a look at the included stylesheet and maybe got inspired for your own stylesheet for your custom theme or even doing your own plugin with this...

== Idea Behind / Philosophy ==
Really, nothing spectacular. At the moment, this plugin is really useable but more of an experiment. I really like other plugins like the popular "Social Profiles Widget" but wanted something a bit more flexible and with another approach. I've released this as a plugin for other users to check it out so I could improve it. It's also intended for users who are no "ccs-coders at heart", so just activate and use :).
